# Development Log

This log tracks major changes, fixes, and improvements made to the WRO project.

## 2024-12-19 - UK Trains MCP Server Setup & ES Module Fixes

### Changes Made:

#### 1. UK Trains MCP Server Development
- **What**: Created a comprehensive UK Trains MCP server with multiple tools
- **Why**: User requested MCP server for UK train information including National Rail and TfL data
- **Files Created**:
  - `uk-trains-server.js` - Initial ES6 module version
  - `uk-trains-server-simple.js` - CommonJS version (failed due to ES module config)
  - `uk-trains-working.js` - CommonJS version (failed due to ES module config)
  - `uk-trains-esm.js` - Final working ES module version
- **Tools Implemented**:
  - `get_train_departures` - Get real-time train departure information
  - `get_tfl_status` - Get Transport for London service status
  - `search_stations` - Search for UK train stations by name

#### 2. ES Module Compatibility Fix
- **What**: Fixed ES module compatibility issues with MCP server
- **Why**: Project uses `"type": "module"` in package.json, requiring ES6 imports instead of CommonJS requires
- **Problem**: `ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope`
- **Solution**: Converted all `require()` statements to `import` statements
- **Files Modified**: Created new ES module version `uk-trains-esm.js`

#### 3. uvx PATH Fix for Fetch Server
- **What**: Installed and configured `uvx` (Python package runner) for fetch server
- **Why**: Fetch server was failing with `Error: spawn uvx ENOENT`
- **Solution**: 
  - Installed uvx using official installer: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
  - Added `~/.local/bin` to PATH in `~/.zshrc`
  - Verified installation with `which uvx`

#### 4. MCP Server Configuration Files
- **What**: Created multiple configuration files for different upload methods
- **Why**: xiaozhi-mcphub supports both manual server addition and DXT file uploads
- **Files Created**:
  - `uk-trains-mcp-config.json` - Basic configuration
  - `uk-trains-mcp-server.json` - Comprehensive configuration with examples
  - `uk-trains-mcp-configuration.json` - DXT upload format
  - `uk-trains-mcp.dxt` - DXT file (attempted ZIP and JSON formats)
  - `setup-uk-trains-mcp.sh` - Setup script for dependencies

#### 5. GitHub Integration & Cursor Rules
- **What**: Set up automatic GitHub uploads and created cursor rules
- **Why**: User requested automatic backup of all changes to GitHub
- **Files Created**:
  - `.cursorrules` - Defines automatic Git workflow
- **Workflow**: Auto-commit and push all changes on every run

#### 6. Development Log System & Git History Cleanup
- **What**: Created comprehensive development log system and fixed git history issues
- **Why**: User requested tracking of all major changes and encountered GitHub file size limits
- **Files Created**:
  - `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` - Comprehensive development log with rules and current session details
- **Files Modified**:
  - `.cursorrules` - Added development log rule requiring documentation of all major changes
- **Git Issues Resolved**:
  - Removed large PostgreSQL installer file (369.86 MB) that exceeded GitHub's 100MB limit
  - Used `git filter-branch` to completely remove file from git history
  - Force-pushed clean history to GitHub

#### 7. MCP Server Testing & Validation
- **What**: Created comprehensive test suite and validated MCP server functionality
- **Why**: Ensure server works correctly before integration with xiaozhi-mcphub
- **Files Created**:
  - `test-uk-trains.js` - Automated test script for MCP server
  - `uk-trains-mcp-final.dxt` - Final DXT package for upload
- **Test Results**: ✅ All tests passed
  - Server initialization successful
  - Tools list returns all 3 tools correctly
  - Tool calls return proper mock data
  - JSON-RPC protocol compliance verified

#### 8. Fetch Server PATH Fix & Service Restart
- **What**: Fixed fetch server `uvx ENOENT` error and restarted xiaozhi-mcphub service
- **Why**: Fetch server was failing because `uvx` wasn't in the PATH when the backend process started
- **Problem**: `Failed to connect: Error: spawn uvx ENOENT`
- **Solution**: 
  - Restarted xiaozhi-mcphub service with proper PATH including `/Users/yliu3y/Library/pnpm:$HOME/.local/bin`
  - Verified `uvx mcp-server-fetch` works correctly
  - Service now has access to both `pnpm` and `uvx` commands
- **Files Modified**: Service restart with corrected PATH environment

#### 9. Music MCP Server Development
- **What**: Created comprehensive music player MCP server with full playback controls
- **Why**: User requested music/song playing capabilities in addition to existing servers
- **Files Created**:
  - `music-mcp-server.js` - Full-featured music player with 7 tools
  - `music-mcp-configuration.json` - Server configuration for xiaozhi-mcphub
  - `music-mcp.dxt` - DXT package for easy upload

- ✅ Fixed Button initialization error and successfully built firmware
- ✅ Successfully flashed firmware with debug logs to ESP32

#### 12. Hardware Pin Configuration Update
- **What**: Updated GPIO pin mappings to match user's actual hardware connections
- **Why**: User provided actual soldered connections which differed from initial configuration
- **User's Actual Connections**:
  - D3 → LRC (Left/Right Clock) - GPIO3
  - D4 → BCLK (Bit Clock) - GPIO4  
  - D5 → DIN (Data Input) - GPIO5
  - SD pin → Enable pin - GPIO7
  - VCC/GND → BAT+/BAT- power connections
  - Speaker connected to SPK+/SPK- on amplifier
- **Files Updated**:
  - `config.h`: Updated I2S pin mappings (GPIO3,4,5 instead of GPIO4,5,6)
  - `seeed_xiao_esp32s3_sense_board.cc`: Updated audio codec initialization with correct pins
- **Test Results**: ✅ Serial monitor shows successful boot with audio system working

#### 13. Firmware Flashing Success
- **What**: Successfully flashed custom firmware to Seeed XIAO ESP32S3 Sense
- **Why**: User requested to flash the updated firmware with correct pin configuration
- **Process**:
  - ESP32 detected on `/dev/tty.usbmodem101` (different port from previous session)
  - Flashed core firmware components: bootloader, main app, partition table, OTA data
  - Skipped `generated_assets.bin` due to 8MB flash size limitation
  - Used correct 8MB flash size parameter
- **Files Flashed**:
  - Bootloader: 16,496 bytes at 0x00000000
  - Main Application: 2,527,264 bytes at 0x00020000 (xiaozhi.bin)
  - Partition Table: 3,072 bytes at 0x00008000
  - OTA Data: 8,192 bytes at 0x0000d000
- **Test Results**: ✅ Firmware flashed successfully with hard reset performed

#### 16. Added ESP32 Project Modification Rule
- **What**: Added a strict rule to `.cursorrules` preventing modifications to core xiaozhi-esp32-main files.
- **Why**: User requested to only modify board-specific folders, not core project files like CMakeLists.txt or Kconfig.projbuild.
- **Files Affected**: `.cursorrules`
- **Technical Impact**: Establishes clear boundaries for future ESP32 development work - only board folders can be modified.
- **Lessons Learned**: Core project files should remain untouched to maintain project integrity.
- **Rule Details**: 
  - ONLY modify files within `xiaozhi-esp32-main/main/boards/[board-name]/`
  - NEVER modify CMakeLists.txt, Kconfig.projbuild, application.cc, or other core files
  - Provide integration instructions instead of direct modifications

### Next Steps:
- Test audio output with MAX98357A amplifier
- Configure WiFi settings for full functionality

### Technical Notes:
- Project uses ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- MCP SDK version: 1.20.1
- Node.js version: v22.14.0
- uvx provides Python package execution capabilities
