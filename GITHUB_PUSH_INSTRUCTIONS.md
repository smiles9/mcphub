Your code is now committed and ready to push to GitHub! 🎉

## 📝 Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to **https://github.com**
2. Click the **"+"** button (top right)
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Enter repository name: `mcphub` (or any name you like)
5. Choose **Public** or **Private**
6. **DO NOT** check any boxes (README, .gitignore, license)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

## 🔗 Connect and Push

After creating the repository, copy the repository URL and run these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcphub.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 Authentication

When you run `git push`, you'll be asked for credentials:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: `mcphub`
4. Expiration: Choose your preference
5. Scopes: Check `repo` (full control of private repositories)
6. Click "Generate token"
7. **Copy the token** (you'll only see it once!)
8. Use this token as your password when pushing

### Option 2: GitHub CLI
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if you prefer
# Then run:
gh auth login
